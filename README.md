# How does salt influence microbial communities? 

Questions: 

1. How is microbial biodiversity modified across a salinity gradient?
	- Null Hypothesis: Microbial biodiversity (*e.g.* richness)  does not vary along a salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: Microbial biodiversity (*e.g.* richness)  will increase as salt concentration lowers. 
		- There is an inverse relationship between richness and salinity.  
2. How does microbial composition change across a salinity gradient? 
	- Null Hypothesis: Microbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient. 
	- Hypothesis: Dominant members of the microbial community are unique in freshwater compared to salt water.
