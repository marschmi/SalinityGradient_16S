# Goals 

1. Infer an error model for in the filtered sequences, separately on forward and reverse reads.
2. Assign ASVs on both forward and reverse reads separately by applying the error model.
3. Merge forward and reverse ASVs into "contiguous ASVs".
4. Generate the first draft of ASV count table.
5. Quality Trimming of ASV lengths.
6. Remove chimeras. 
7. Assign Taxonomy with Silva Database. 
8. Write out relevant files: `asv_table`, `asvs_fasta`, `tax_table`, and `sample_data`.

## Input 

1. Filtered fastq files generated from `01_QualityTrimming.Rmd`.
2. Sample Name vector.

## Output 

1. ASV Count Table: `asv_table` (with and without sequence names)
2. ASV fasta file: `asvs_fasta` for building a phylogenetic tree at a later step.
3. Taxonomy Table  `tax_table`
4. Sample Information: `sample_data`  track the reads lots throughout DADA2 workflow. 

# Set up the Environment 

## Set Seed & Threads

We need to be mindful of others when we are using the server. We learned in this lesson that we can use `top` and `htop` in the shell to see how many users are currently on the server. So, if you're working through something outside of class, it's ok to increase the number of threads. And, it will make everything go faster! 

Then, when we have a `multithread` parameter, we can set it to be `multithread = n_threads`. If we notice more people on the server, we can modify the n_threads in this one location. 

```{r set-seed}
# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(238428)

# Let's make a parameter to set the number of threads 
n_threads = 20
```

## Timing of this script

Let's record how long this file took to run on the class server, which we will record at the end of the script. 

```{r rmd-start}
# What time did we start running this script? 
start_time <- Sys.time()
```


## Load Packages 
```{r load-packages}
# Efficient package loading with pacman 
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, devtools, dada2, 
               patchwork, DT, install = FALSE)
```

## Load Filtered Fastq Files 

```{r load-filtered-fastqs}
# Place filtered seq files into a variable 
filtered_fastqs_path <- "data/01_DADA2/02_filtered_fastqs"

# Intuition check:
filtered_fastqs_path

# Create Forward vector 
filtered_forward_reads <- 
  list.files(filtered_fastqs_path, pattern = "R1_filtered.fastq.gz",
             full.names = TRUE)
# Check 
filtered_forward_reads[1:5]

# Reverse vector 
filtered_reverse_reads <- 
    list.files(filtered_fastqs_path, pattern = "R2_filtered.fastq.gz",
             full.names = TRUE)

# Check 
filtered_reverse_reads[1:5]
```

## Sample Names 
```{r sample-names}
# Create vector of sample names from the filenames 
sample_names <- sapply(strsplit(basename(filtered_forward_reads), "_"), `[`,1) 

# Intuition Check 
head(sample_names)
```


# Error Modelling 

## How does it work? 

This is the step along the workflow where we try to estimate what is a *mistake* from technological sequencing error versus what is *true biological variation*. Therefore, this step is another critical step that we need to be mindful of! This is also what makes DADA2 unique!  

Specifically, we will infer error rates for all possible *transitions* within purines and pyrimidines (A<>G or C<>T) and *transversions* between all purine and pyrimidine combinations. The error model is learned by alternating estimation of the error rates and inference of sample composition until they converge. It starts with abundant sequences first and then goes to less abundant sequences. It will:  

1. Starts with the assumption that the error rates are the maximum (takes the most abundant sequence ("center") and assumes it's the only sequence not caused by errors).  
2. Compares the other sequences to the most abundant sequence. 
3. Uses at most 10^8^ nucleotides for the error estimation. (Though, sometimes we increase this parameter in the case of binned sequencing quality scores.)  
4. Uses parametric error estimation function of loess fit on the observed error rates. 

## Important Notes

**First, every individual sequencing run needs to have it's own and separate error model!** This is because every sequencing run is unique—even if the flow cell and DNA/samples are *exactly the same*. 

While you can combine multiple datasets together after running them through DADA2, if you'd like to limit bias and combine data sets from multiple sequencing runs, it is ideal to do the following:  

1. Use the exact same DNA extractions and library prep (*e.g.* same primer sets). 
2. Perform the exact same `filterAndTrim()`, with equivalent parameters between sequencing runs. This is because we need to have the exact same ASV length expected by the output of our filtering and trimming.
3. Assign ASVs on forward and reverse reads, merge them, and then once you have the ASV table from each sequencing run, you can merge them together.

But wait: *What contributes to sequencing error in different sequencing runs and why do we need to model errors separately per run with `learnErrors()` in dada2?* Remember the core principles of how Illumina sequencing works! Some things that contribute to this are:  

a. Each sequencing run has a **unique timing for when clusters go out of sync** (*e.g.,* the drop in quality at end of reads, which is typical of Illumina sequencing. This decrease in read quality is especially true of older Illumina sequencing data and is improving with more recent technologies. 
b. The **cluster density is impossible to replicate**. Therefore, the cluster density (and therefore sequence quality) will always be different between sequencing runs (even if it's the same person/samples/sequencing facility!). This is getting easier to replicate with the newer flow cells (*e.g.,* patterned flow cells) but is not yet possible. 
c. **PhiX spike-in will also vary between runs**, even if we try to make it the same! Therefore, the amount of heterogeneity on the flow cell will also be different, which further impacting the sequencing quality.  
d. **Different locations on the flow cell can be impacted differently between runs.** Perhaps an air bubble can get in. Or, as mentioned above, the cluster density is higher and/or lower on a different run/flow cell. In the old, non-patterned flow cells, sometimes clusters can form nearby each other. However, this has been solved on the new, patterned flow cells where clusters have a specific distance between each other. 

**Second, this step uses our quality scores, which is rapidly changing with new sequencing technologies!** Therefore, we need to be mindful of how we run our error models. The traditional error models were developed based on the 40 Phred scores that were generated by early Illumina Sequencing technologies. However, with the new binned quality scores, we need to incorporate new ways of error modeling and this is constanstly changing right now, which you can see in this [very active discussion on the DADA2 GitHub page](https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2/issues/1307). 

Now, let's consider the two types of Illumina data output and how it might inform our error modeling. 

## Learn the Errors

### MiSeq Runs: 40 Phred Scores

Here, in the data we have sequenced here, we have Illumina MiSeq data with the traditional 40 Phred scores. Therefore, we can use the traditional `learnErrors()` command, which we will do below. 

```{r learn-errors-MiSeq, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Forward Reads 
error_forward_reads <- 
  learnErrors(filtered_forward_reads, multithread = n_threads)

# Forward Error Plot 
forward_error_plot <- 
  plotErrors(error_forward_reads, nominalQ = TRUE) + 
  labs(title = "Forward Reads: Error Model")

# Reverse Reads 
error_reverse_reads <- 
  learnErrors(filtered_reverse_reads, multithread = n_threads)

# Reverse Error Plot 
reverse_error_plot <- 
  plotErrors(error_reverse_reads, nominalQ = TRUE) + 
  labs(title = "Reverse Reads: Error Model")

# Look at the plots together 
forward_error_plot + reverse_error_plot
```

The above plot represents the error rates for each possible transition (A→C, A→G, …) in the forward reads (on the left) and the reverse reads (on the right).

Details of the plots above: 
- **Points**: The observed error rates for each consensus quality score.  
- **Black line**: Estimated error rates after convergence of the machine-learning algorithm.  
- **Red line:** The error rates expected under the nominal definition of the Q-score.  

Similar to what is mentioned in the [DADA2 tutorial](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial_1_8.html): the estimated error rates (black line) are a "reasonably good" fit to the observed rates (points), and the error rates drop with increased quality as expected.  We can now infer ASVs! 

# Infer ASVs

**An important note:** What makes DADA2 so nice is that it infers ASVs separately on the forward and the reverse reads and then merges them afterwards. This is quite a different approach from how OTUs are identified in Mothur and also from UCHIME, oligotyping, and other OTU, MED, and ASV approaches.

```{r infer-ASVs}
# Infer ASVs on the forward sequences
dada_forward <- 
  dada(filtered_forward_reads, 
       err = error_forward_reads,
       multithread = n_threads) 

# Take a look at the data
# What type of data structure is it? 
typeof(dada_forward) # It's a list 
length(dada_forward) # How big is it? One per sample!

# What doees it look like for each sample?  
dada_forward$`20210602-MA-CES1F_R1_filtered.fastq.gz`

# Reverse ASVs
dada_reverse <- 
  dada(filtered_reverse_reads,
       err = error_reverse_reads ,
       multithread = n_threads)

# Check data 
dada_reverse[30]
```

# Merge Forward and Reverse ASVs 

Now, that we have identified our ASVs separately on both the forward and the reverse reads, let's **merge** them together into contiguous (*aka* "contigs") ASVs.

```{r merge-ASVs}
merged_ASVs <- 
  mergePairs(dada_forward, filtered_forward_reads,
             dada_reverse, filtered_reverse_reads,
             verbose = TRUE)

# Evaluate the data output 
typeof(merged_ASVs) # A list
length(merged_ASVs) # Length of the number of samples!
names(merged_ASVs) # Here, we can access our current sample names

# Inspect further for each sample
head(merged_ASVs) # A dataframe for each sample
# We have a dataframe in each part of our list! 
str(merged_ASVs$`20210602-MA-CEB1W_R1_filtered.fastq.gz`)
# What are in the columns? 
glimpse(merged_ASVs$`20210602-MA-CEB1W_R1_filtered.fastq.gz`)
```



# Create Raw ASV Count Table 

```{r raw-ASV-count-table}
# Raw ASV
raw_ASV_table <- makeSequenceTable(merged_ASVs)

# Intuition Check: Type and dimensions of the data
dim(raw_ASV_table)
typeof(raw_ASV_table)
class(raw_ASV_table)

# write out raw_asv_table 
write.table(raw_ASV_table, file = "data/01_DADA2/raw_ASV_counts.tsv",
            sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, col.names = NA)
```

# Assess the ASV Length 

# Assess ASV Quality 

## What are the current ASV lengths? 

First, let's inspect the distribution of the ASV sequence lengths across all of the ASVs that we have inferred. First, we need to consider: **What is the length of ASV that expect?** 

Here, we have sequenced the 16S rRNA V4 hypervariable region with the 515F and 806R primers. Therefore: 

1. *What's the total length of our starting amplicons?* 
    - Our primers are named after the location they bind to on the 16S gene. So: 
    - `806 - 515 = 291` 
    - The total length of the starting amplicon is 291 base pairs, with primers.
2. *What is the ASV length without primers?* 
    - The 515F (`GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA`) primer is 19 base pairs. 
    - The 806R (`GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT`) primer is 20 base pairs. 
    - `291 - 19 - 20 = 252` 
    - The expected ASV length without primers is **252 base pairs**. 
    - **IMPORTANT:** Remember, we did not sequence the primers in our current example, because the [Kozich et al., 2013](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01043-13) library prep was used. However, if the regular Illumina 2-step library preparation approach was used, the primers will be sequenced!
3. *What is the length of the trimmed ASVs after `filterAndTrim()`?* 
    - In our `01_QualityTrimming.Rmd`, we used `trimLeft = 8` to remove the bases at the beginning of the forward read and `truncLen = c(250, 248)`, which kept the full forward read length and removed 2 bases at the end of the reverse read. Therefore: 
    - `252 - 8 = 244`
4. *What is the overlap between our forward and reverse reads?*
    - We performed 2x250 paired-end Illumina MiSeq Sequencing. However, from our multiQC report, we can see that our read length is actually 251 bp. 
    - Length of unique forward ASV sequence: `251 - 19 = 232`
    - Length of unique reverse ASV sequence: `251 - 20 = 231`
    - If we have a total read length of 252 base pairs, then our overlap will be `232/251 = 0.924` or 92.4% between our forward and reverse ASVs. 

### ASV Length Stats 

```{r assess-ASV-length}
# Calculate summary stats
# Longest ASV?
maxLength_ASV <- max(nchar(getSequences(raw_ASV_table)))

# Shortest ASV?
minLength_ASV <- min(nchar(getSequences(raw_ASV_table))) 

# Mean ASV length?
meanLength_ASV <- mean(nchar(getSequences(raw_ASV_table))) 

# Median ASV length?
medianLength_ASV <- median(nchar(getSequences(raw_ASV_table))) 

# Create a table to Inspect the distribution of sequence lengths of all ASVs in dataset 
table(nchar(getSequences(raw_ASV_table)))
```

In the table above, we can see that we actually have quite the ASV sequence length distribution! There are some longer ASVs that are clearly spurious... we need to be **skeptical**! Here's some of the stats that we've calculated:

- Max ASV length: `r maxLength_ASV` base pairs
- Min ASV length: `r minLength_ASV` base pairs
- Mean ASV length: `r meanLength_ASV` base pairs
- Median ASV length: `r medianLength_ASV` base pairs

*Let's take a look at what this looks like graphically!*

### ASV Length Plot 

Now, we will plot these ASV lengths to give us a better idea: 

```{r ASV-lengths-plot}
# Inspect the distribution of sequence lengths of all ASVs in data set 
# AFTER TRIM
data.frame(Seq_Length = nchar(getSequences(raw_ASV_table))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Seq_Length )) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  # include the x-axis scales
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, maxLength_ASV + 5)) + 
  labs(title = "Raw distribution of ASV length",
       y = "Number of ASVs", x = "ASV Sequence Length (bps)")
```

As we saw in the table, the length of the ASVs is mostly 245 base pairs. 

## Trim ASV lengths 

Now that we are pretty convinced that we have some spurious ASVs, we will trim ASVs that are higher or lower than 245 base pairs in this data set. 

**NOTE:** This is another moment in our workflow where we are sub-setting only the "good parts" of our data to ensure the data quality we have at the end is the best of our ability based on the sequencing run. 

*Let's trim the ASVs to only be the right size, which is 245!* 

```{r trim-ASVs}
# Subset only ASVs that are 245 bps long 
raw_ASV_table_trimmed <- 
  raw_ASV_table[,nchar(colnames(raw_ASV_table)) == 245]

# Inspect the distribution of sequence lengths of all ASVs in dataset 
table(nchar(getSequences(raw_ASV_table_trimmed)))

# What proportion of total ASV sequences are left in the data? 
sum(raw_ASV_table_trimmed)/sum(raw_ASV_table)

# Inspect the distribution of sequence lengths of all ASVs in dataset 
# AFTER TRIM
data.frame(Seq_Length = nchar(getSequences(raw_ASV_table_trimmed))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Seq_Length )) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  # include the x-axis scales
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, maxLength_ASV + 5)) + 
  labs(title = "Trimmed distribution of ASV length",
       y = "Number of ASVs", x = "ASV Sequence Length (bps)")

```

**Note the peak at 245 is ABOVE 3000 ASVs!** Now, we have ASV lengths that are only 245 bp and we can move forward onto the next quality control step: removing chimeras. 


# Remove Chimeras

## What is a chimera? 

In 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a **chimera** is an artificial DNA sequence that forms when two or more different DNA templates are mistakenly and erroneously fused together during PCR amplification. **Chimeric sequences do not represent real organisms and must be removed during data processing to avoid false species identifications!** Chimeras are natural artifacts in PCR, especially in high-cycle (>25 cycle) PCR reactions, which are typical in library preparation and sequencing workflows. They arise during: 

1. *Incomplete Extension in Early PCR Cycles.* During early PCR cycles, a DNA fragment may partially amplify before the polymerase detaches. This incomplete product remains in the reaction mixture.
2. *Template Switching in Later PCR Cycles.* In subsequent cycles, the polymerase may bind to and extend a different but similar template, rather than the original one. This results in a hybrid (chimeric) DNA molecule made of two unrelated 16S rRNA gene fragments.
3. *There is increased chimera formation in high-diversity samples.* More diverse microbial communities increase the chance of chimeric formation due to similar overlapping sequences in the sample. Longer PCR extension times and too many PCR cycles (>30) increase chimera formation by allowing more template switching.

## Chimeras must be removed 

- **Chimeras create false ASVs:** Chimeric sequences do not belong to any real microbial species, leading to artificial diversity in sequencing results.
- **Chimeras can mislead ecological interpretations** If not removed, they can inflate richness estimates and misrepresent community composition.

Therefore, chimera removal is an essential step in the analysis of 16S sequencing data to improve the accuracy of downstream analyses, such as taxonomic assignment and diversity assessment. It helps to avoid the inclusion of misleading or spurious sequences that could lead to incorrect biological interpretations. 

```{r rm-chimeras, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3}
# Remove the chimeras in the raw ASV table
noChimeras_ASV_table <- 
  removeBimeraDenovo(raw_ASV_table_trimmed, 
                     method="consensus", 
                     multithread = n_threads, 
                     verbose=TRUE)

# Check the dimensions
dim(noChimeras_ASV_table)

# What proportion is left of the sequences? 
percRetained_chimerasTrimmed <- sum(noChimeras_ASV_table)/sum(raw_ASV_table_trimmed)
percRetained_chimerasRaw <-sum(noChimeras_ASV_table)/sum(raw_ASV_table)

# Plot it 
data.frame(Seq_Length_NoChim = nchar(getSequences(noChimeras_ASV_table))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Seq_Length_NoChim )) + 
  geom_histogram()+ 
  # include the x-axis scales
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, maxLength_ASV + 5)) + 
  labs(title = "Trimmed + Chimera Removal distribution of ASV length",
       y = "Number of ASVs", x = "ASV Sequence Length (bps)")
```

**Note the peak at 245 is now BELOW 3000 ASVs!** So, we have removed 241 ASVs, which were chimeras. This retained `r round(percRetained_chimerasTrimmed *100, digits=2)`% of the trimmed ASV counts and only `r round(percRetained_chimerasRaw *100, digits=2)`% of the raw merged ASV counts. 

# Track the read counts

Here, we will look at the number of reads that were lost in the filtering, denoising, merging, and chimera removal. 

```{r track-reads, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
# A little function to identify number seqs 
getN <- function(x) sum(getUniques(x))

# Make the table to track the seqs 
track <- cbind(sapply(dada_forward, getN),
               sapply(dada_reverse, getN),
               sapply(merged_ASVs, getN),
               rowSums(noChimeras_ASV_table))

head(track)

# Update column names to be more informative (most are missing at the moment!)
colnames(track) <- c("denoisedF", "denoisedR", "merged", "nochim")
rownames(track) <- sample_names

# Generate a dataframe to track the reads through our DADA2 pipeline
track_counts_df <- 
  track %>%
  # make it a dataframe
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "names")

# Visualize it in table format 
DT::datatable(track_counts_df)

# Plot it!
track_counts_df %>%
  pivot_longer(denoisedF:nochim, names_to = "read_type", values_to = "num_reads") %>%
  mutate(read_type = fct_relevel(read_type, "denoisedF", "denoisedR", "merged", "nochim")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = read_type, y = num_reads, fill = read_type)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = names), color = "grey") + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral") + 
  labs(x = "Filtering Step", y = "Number of Sequences") + 
  theme_bw()
```



# Assign Taxonomy 

Here, we will use the **silva database version 138.2**, which has been properly formatted for DADA2. The files came from this [DADA2-formatted reference databases website](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html), which hosts several other reference taxomoy files for several popular taxonomic databases. 

In this example, we are going to use the database that is pre-downloaded to the server at the following path: `/workdir/in_class_data/taxonomy/`. You are welcome to symbolically link the taxonomy files, however note that they are VERY LARGE. So, it is actually suggested here (for this one time) to use the absolute path here. However, we need to note that this would break our reproducibility! 

## How does the taxonomy work? 

The `assignTaxonomy` function  implements the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Naive Bayesian Classifier algorithm described in Wang et al. (2007), published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, with a kmer size of 8 and 100 bootstrap replicates. 

```{r assign-tax}
# Assign up to genus level 
taxa_train <- 
  assignTaxonomy(noChimeras_ASV_table, 
                 refFasta = "/workdir/in_class_data/taxonomy/silva_nr99_v138.2_toGenus_trainset.fa.gz", 
                 multithread = n_threads)

# Add the genus/species information 
taxa_addSpecies <- 
  addSpecies(taxa_train, 
              refFasta = "/workdir/in_class_data/taxonomy/silva_v138.2_assignSpecies.fa.gz")

# Inspect the taxonomy 
glimpse(taxa_addSpecies) # Note that the rownames are the ASV sequences!
# Let's removing the ASV sequence rownames for display only
taxa_print <- taxa_addSpecies 
rownames(taxa_print) <- NULL
head(taxa_print)
#View(taxa_print)
```


# Export the Data

Remember from the beginning of the file under "Goals", we wanted to export 4 different types of information: 

1. ASV Count Table: `asv_table` (with and without sequence names)
2. ASV fasta file: `asvs_fasta` for building a phylogenetic tree at a later step.
3. Taxonomy Table  `tax_table`
4. Sample Information: `sample_data`  track the reads lots throughout DADA2 workflow. 


## 1. ASV Tables

We will export the following two ASV count tables, which will be in "long" format where the **ASVs are in rows** and the **sample names are in the columns.**

1. **With ASV seqs:** ASV headers include the *entire* ASV sequence 245 bases.
2. **with ASV names:** This includes re-written and shortened headers like ASV_1, ASV_2, etc, which will match the names in our fasta file below.

### Structure of ASV tables

Let's check that the ASVs are in the rows and the sample names are in the columns. If not, we can use the transpose function `t()` in R. 

```{r structure-ASV-table}
# What's the current format of the ASV table?
head(rownames(noChimeras_ASV_table)) # Samples!
head(colnames(noChimeras_ASV_table)) # ASV Sequences

# Therefore, we need to transpose the matrix 
final_ASV_table_withSeqs <- t(noChimeras_ASV_table)

# Intuition check
head(rownames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs)) # ASV Sequences
head(colnames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs)) # Sample names
```

### Names in ASV tables

#### Fix Sample Names 

Notice above that the sample names are actually file names. Let's fix this! 

> WARNING! This is an easy place where a silent error can step in where we could misname our samples, leading to catastrophe down the road. So, we need to be very careful and complete our checks and balances so we ensure the samples are not mixed up in the renaming process. 

```{r SampleNames-ASV-table}
# Remember at the top of the file we created a vector of sample names 
head(sample_names)
# Let's check with the actual column names 
head(colnames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs)) # Sample names
# And then apply our sample name script to check, too
head(sapply(strsplit(colnames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs), "_"), `[`,1)) # Looks good! 

# Now, add a break in the script break if this isn't true! 
# Let's make sure the sample names match the file names in the matrix.
stopifnot(sapply(strsplit(colnames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs), "_"), `[`,1) == sample_names)

# Now, we've done some checks to prove to ourselves there will be no silent errors, 
# Let's rename! 
colnames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs) <- sample_names
head(colnames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs))
```

#### Rename ASVs

Then, we can also fix the names of our ASVs for our second ASV table where we will replace the ASV sequence names with ASV_1, ASV_2

```{r prepare-ASVcount-Seqtable}
# Give headers more manageable names
# First pull the ASV sequences from the rownames
ASV_seqs <- rownames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs)
ASV_seqs[1:5]

# How many ASVs? 
num_ASVs <- dim(final_ASV_table_withSeqs)[1] # select the number of rows
num_ASVs 

# Make an empty vector the length of the number of ASVs, 
# which is where we will place the new operational ASV names 
ASV_headers <- vector(num_ASVs, mode = "character")

# Let's mae sure we have an empty vector!
ASV_headers[1:5]
length(ASV_headers) # looks good! 

# Now, let's create a vector with ASV numbers
# loop through vector and fill it in with ASV names 
for (i in 1:num_ASVs) {
  # Add leading zero to ASV name so they print in correct order.
  ASV_number <- sprintf("%04d", i)
  # Now, rename each spot in the ASV header vector as we loop through the for loop
  ASV_headers[i] <- paste(">ASV", ASV_number, sep = "_")
}

# Intuition check
ASV_headers[1:5]

# Create a new ASV table, which will have the ASV numbers as names 
# View(noChimeras_ASV_table) # To view the table
final_ASV_table <- final_ASV_table_withSeqs
glimpse(final_ASV_table)

## Replace the ASV seqs with the ASV numbers 
row.names(final_ASV_table) <- sub(">", "", ASV_headers)
final_ASV_table[1:5, 1:5]
#View(final_ASV_table) # To view the table
``` 

### Write the ASV Tables!

1. **With ASV seqs:** ASV headers include the *entire* ASV sequence 245 bases.
2. **with ASV names:** This includes re-written and shortened headers like ASV_1, ASV_2, etc, which will match the names in our fasta file below.

```{r write-asv-tables}
# 1. Write count table with ASV sequence names
write.table(final_ASV_table_withSeqs, 
            file = "data/01_DADA2/ASV_table_withSeqNames.tsv", 
            sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, col.names = NA)

# 2. Write count table with ASV numbered names (e.g. ASV_1, ASV_2, etc)
write.table(final_ASV_table, 
            file = "data/01_DADA2/ASV_table.tsv", 
            sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, col.names = NA)
```


## 2. ASV Fasta File 

Now, let's create a fasta file that has our ASV numbers with each of their corresponding ASV sequences. This file needs to be created because we will use it later to build a phylogenetic tree. 

**Why do we need a phylogenetic tree?** Many widely used microbial ecology metrics rely on phylogenetic relationships to quantify community similarity. For example, there are phylogenetic alpha-diversity metrics like the [phylogenetic Hill Numbers](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-120213-091540) and also beta-diversity measures that incorporate the branch lenghts of phylogenetic trees as it relates to community dissimimlarity, [like the abundance-unweighted and abundance-weighted UniFrac dissimilarity metrics](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.71.12.8228-8235.2005). These metrics consider species presence and their evolutionary distances, conveying relationships of communities through an ecological *and* evolutionary framework. 

### Write the ASV Fasta File

```{r write-asv-fastas}
# Let's take our asv_headers
head(ASV_headers, n = 2)
# And combine it with their sequences
head(ASV_seqs, n = 2)

# Combine in a fasta format with the cbind() function
ASV_fasta <- c(rbind(ASV_headers, ASV_seqs))
head(ASV_fasta, n = 4)

# Then, let's write it to a fasta file!
# This will be our reference later on for which seq matches which ASV
write(ASV_fasta, "data/01_DADA2/ASVs.fasta")
```

## 3. Taxonomy Table 

Before we actually write the taxonomy table, let's put the ASV sequences as another column in our taxonomy table and then replace the rownames to be our numbered ASV names. 

### Reformat Taxonomy 

1. Move ASV sequences to column 
2. Replace ASV rownames with ASV numbered names

> WARNING! This is another easy place where a silent error can step in!! Here, we could accidentally misname our ASVs. So, we need to be very careful and perform intuition checks to ensure that the ASV names are not mixed up in the renaming process. 

```{r reformat-tax-table}
# Inspect the taxonomy table
dim(taxa_addSpecies) # ASVs are in rows and Kingdom, Phylum, etc in Columns 
colnames(taxa_addSpecies) # Column names are Linnean Taxonomy 
head(rownames(taxa_addSpecies), n = 2) # ASV names are rownames 
class(taxa_addSpecies) # Character matrix

##### Prepare tax table 
# 1. Add the ASV sequences from the rownames to a column 
new_tax_table <- 
  taxa_addSpecies%>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "ASVseqs") 

# Intuition check 
glimpse(new_tax_table)

# IMPORTANT! Let's do our intuition check 
# This is where we ensure we don't mix up the ASV names!
stopifnot(new_tax_table$ASVseqs == rownames(final_ASV_table_withSeqs))

# Now let's add the ASV names 
rownames(new_tax_table) <- rownames(final_ASV_table)
head(new_tax_table)

### Final prep of tax table. Add new column with ASV names 
ASV_tax_table <- 
  new_tax_table %>%
  # add rownames from count table for phyloseq handoff
  mutate(ASV = rownames(final_ASV_table)) %>%
  # Reorder the columns
  dplyr::select(Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, ASV, ASVseqs)

# Assign the rownames, which is required by phyloseq
rownames(ASV_tax_table) <- ASV_tax_table$ASV

# Take a quick look
glimpse(ASV_tax_table)

# Intution check
stopifnot(ASV_tax_table$ASV == rownames(ASV_tax_table), 
          rownames(ASV_tax_table) == rownames(ASV_tax_table))
```

### Write the Taxonomy Table 

Now, let's write out the taxonomy table 

```{r write-tax-table}
# Write the table 
write.table(ASV_tax_table, 
            file = "data/01_DADA2/ASV_taxonomy.tsv", 
            sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, col.names = NA)
```


## 4. Sample Data 

Let's save the `track_counts_df`, which can be useful for downstream analyses. 

```{r save-track reads}
# And save the track_counts_df a R object, which we will merge with metadata information in the next step of the analysis in nalysis/02_Taxonomic_Assignment. 
save(track_counts_df, file = "data/01_DADA2/track_read_counts.RData")
```

# Final info for Reproducibility 

## Check Render Time
```{r stop-time}
# Take the time now that we are at the end of the script
end_time <- Sys.time()
end_time 

# Echo the elapsed time
elapsed_time <- round((end_time - start_time), 3)
elapsed_time
```

## Session Information

```{r session-info}
# Ensure reproducibility with package version information
devtools::session_info()
```
